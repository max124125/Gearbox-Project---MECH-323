Executive Summary
In Phase 3, students are tasked with analyzing and redesigning shafts for a race vehicle using AISI
4130 steel, quenched and tempered at425Â°C. The shafts are integral for transmitting torque from
the motor to the wheels, supported by pillow bearings. The vehicle competes in a super
endurance race, requiring continuous operation for 24/7 over 5 years. The safety analysis
involves ensuring a safety factor against fatigue failure of no less than 1 for all critical points on
both the pinion and gear shafts. Seven tasks are outlined, including determining corrected
endurance limits, identifying external forces and torques, analyzing design features, drawing
bending moment and torque diagrams, calculating midrange torque and resultant amplitude
moment, and determining safety factors using DE-Gerber criterion.
The corrected endurance limit was calculated to be 732.86 MPa and the radial and tangential
forces for the pinion and gear are summarized in Table 4. For In regard to the critical points, 10
critical points were identified for the pinion shaft and 11 for the gear shaft. These critical points
were primarily located at shoulder fillets where there is a change in diameter, while the rest are
due to applied torque and load from gears. The static and dynamic stress concentration factor
was also computed for all critical points and are summarized in Table 6. The midrange torque for
the pinion and gear shaft were found to be 2.553 Nm and 0.929 Nm and used to compute the
resultant amplitude moment, which is summarized in Tables 8 and 9. It was assumed that Ta and
Mm were zero everywhere. Finally, the calculated safety factors all surpass 1, affirming that the
shaft designs meet the criteria and are deemed valid for further progression.
