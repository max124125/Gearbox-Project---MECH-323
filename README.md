This project was done throughout the MECH 323 course, and had the goal of designing, assembling and 3D printing a gearbox for a small battery powered model car. 
The gearbox had to be optimized for both a top speed event and ramp climb event, and able to shift between these two gear ratios within only a few seconds of human interaction.

An image of the gearbox before being placed in the car is found below. And
the final report along with the CAD files submitted for this project can be found in the section above.
